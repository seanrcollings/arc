Command can also be defined with a class, instead of a function.

For example, this command:

```py title="examples/hello.py"
--8<-- "examples/hello.py"
```

Could be written as:

```py title="examples/classful.py"
--8<-- "examples/classful.py"
```

```console
--8<-- "examples/outputs/classful"
```

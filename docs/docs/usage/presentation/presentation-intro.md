*arc* contains a set of utilties for presenting output to the user. They are all exported from the `arc.present` package, although some of them are also re-exported in the top-level `arc` package for convenience.

!!! note
    These utilites are intedend to be simple, if you need more flexibility / power I would reccomend using something like [rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich).

Here are the sections covered:

- [Printing / Logging](./printing.md)
- [Coloring Output](./coloring.md)
- [Rich Output](./rich-output.md)
